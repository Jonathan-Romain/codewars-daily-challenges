// Find max(abs(length(x) âˆ’ length(y)))

// If a1 and/or a2 are empty return -1 in each language except in Haskell (F#) where you will return Nothing (None).

// Example:
// a1 = ["hoqq", "bbllkw", "oox", "ejjuyyy", "plmiis", "xxxzgpsssa", "xxwwkktt", "znnnnfqknaz", "qqquuhii", "dvvvwz"]
// a2 = ["cccooommaaqqoxii", "gggqaffhhh", "tttoowwwmmww"]

// input : 2 strings with substrings separated by ,
// output: number as a string
