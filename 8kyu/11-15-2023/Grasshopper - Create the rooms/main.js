// Escape the room
// You are creating an "Escape the room" game. The first step is to create a hash table called rooms that contains all of the rooms of the game. There should be at least 3 rooms inside it, each being a hash table with at least three properties (e.g. name, description, completed).








// Add rooms here
var rooms = {
    room1:{
      name: 'Texas',
      description: 'Big',
      completed: true
    },
    room2:{
      name: 'Nevada',
      description: 'Desert',
      completed: true
    },
    room3:{
      name: 'Iowa',
      description: 'Cold',
      completed: false
    }
  }
